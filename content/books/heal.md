  About the Book




  Pain takes us on a pretty long journey. It’s true that pain sometimes pushes us to be more but taking time to reflect and heal is also important. Scars can only become trophies if they heal; lest it is scratched a bit and it all opens up again.




  Through the pages of this book, the author hopes to walk you through what a journey of pain could look like from the onset to the point of healing.




  The author of the book knows a bit about pain. Tied with the cords of depression for a few months until she finally found healing at the Living-Spring.




  You can find healing as well, let’s take this journey together.
