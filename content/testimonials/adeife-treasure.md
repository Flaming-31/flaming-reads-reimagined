message: Reading HEAL was like opening a book of remembrance. I could just
  relate to every bit of words and those words gave me strength and assurance.
  It made me remind myself of who I am and who God wants me to be. It brought me
  back into the consciousness of who God is and how much he wants us to let him
  into every pain, hurt, brokenness and wounds of our heart. It made me realise
  that God doesn't want to mend our hearts, He wants to make it whole and His.
  In all, this book is great and just what I needed at this time.
