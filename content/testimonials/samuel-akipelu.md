  So about HEAL...

  For me, I can't say I've ever been deeply hurt emotionally before but as I'm typing this, I remember I lost a close friend some years ago, I really cried... I actually really cried

  So back to HEAL....

  While reading the book, I got to a point where I had to pause and take time to think of the fact that people are really going through stuffs Because as I was reading it, I was seeing a lot of look alike stories of many people I know and I can relate a bit with it.

  Also, I can't lie to the fact that I always look forward to the end part of each poem, to actually see how things turned out for the said character

  Chapter 10 is just my best chapter.
