  Firstly, a huge thank you to the author of this book. God bless you for
  creating this masterpiece. 


  Reading this book helped me realize that God is always ready to support us in our journey to healing. 


  We just need to be open with Him about our struggles. 


  It showed me that even in our pain, we shouldn't distance ourselves from Him; that's when we need Him the most. 


  Through Him, we can find peace. As the author says, Papa will guide you to real rest. 


  It also reminded me that even when negative voices try to bring us down, we must remember who God says we are. 


  We are children of light, and we should shine brightly. 


  I learned that fear only exists in our minds, and we shouldn't let it stop us from becoming who the Lord has called us to be. 


  The author reminds me that I have a purpose, and I should respond to His call. Fear has no power over me. 


  It made me know that God is ready to take my burdens; I just need to lay it upon him. 


  I am part of a chosen generation, a royal priesthood. Everything I need is found in Him. I am who He says I am. 💃🥰


  It taught me that God should be at the centre of everything in our lives. We shouldn't face our pain alone. 


  God wants to make us whole and heal our hearts. 


  It also made me know that nations are waiting to hear my voice, but I need to heal first to be able to lead rightly. 


  The truth is, healing process can be challenging, but with the Holy Spirit's help and proper therapy, it is achievable. 


  This book has charged me up to heal and get better. Because I'm not living for me alone. Generations are tied to me. 


  I won't let pain stop me from receiving God's beautiful promises. I will heal. 


  I love every part of this book. Actually, it came to me at the perfect time. 


  The first day I saw it at church, I smiled and thought, God is so intentional about me. 


  I was going through a tough time that only He knew about, and He blessed me with this book, HEAL, Awaken, dear soul, by Sister Toluwani. 


  I'm grateful I read it. If you're struggling and finding it hard to heal, trust me, this book is what you need. 


  The storytelling is excellent, and the affirmations and encouragement from the author are incredible.
